How to Write Markdown  files!
Let’s do that…
 Firstly , the _file extension_  should be  ** md ** 
Are you wondering file extension became italic and md as bold!
Let me tell you its secret…
Haha , it’s the syntax…
Okay, let’s together learn how to write  **  markdown files  **

Headings
 For adding headings in markdown files, mark down support 6 levels of formatting from level1 to level 6.
# for level 1, ## level22, ### level 3 and so on.. up to 6.
Note: there should be space before the header Text.

Italic 
For doing text in italic format underscore followed by text in between and underscore i.e
( _sometext_ )

Bold
For doing text in bold format , you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ) before and after the word.
** bolded text **

You can do both italic and bold at the same time
_** text **_  or  **_ text_**

1.inline link : link text in  brackets ( ) and link in square brackets [ ]
e.g:  2.reference link: link text in first square brackets [ ] and reference  in another square brackets [ ],
The reference should be assigned with an link.
e.g:  
Images
The syntax is similar to link, except exclamation at the beginning
